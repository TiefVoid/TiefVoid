                    <h3>Origins of Khordad</h3>
                    <p>The four stars said to watch over Khordad, they are the oldest gods in the continent, and considered the patrons of each of the settlements in the Central Valley; the geographical position of these is related to their corresponding Star. This is the main belief in this region, although expressively allowing worship of other deities.</p>

                    <p>These entities are the ones who are said to have molded Khordad and shaped it into what it is today; the other gods present were allowed to seek worship in their land out of their benevolence.</p>

                    <hr id="venant">

                    <h4>Venant</h4>
                    <div class="5u"><span class="image left"><img src="images/leonin.webp" alt=""></span></div>
                    <p>Venant is the triumphant star, the victor. He is the embodiment of strength and leadership, and thus becomes the patron deity of the imperial city of Minoo and head of the Royal Stars. He points to the North and watches over this section of the continent, as well as overseeing the coming of the summer solstice.</p>

                    <p>Outside of the Central Valley, other regions have also referred to this deity as Regulus or "the prince" in reference to his authority but also his eternal youthfulness. On the mortal realm his shape is that of a Leonin due to belonging to a constellation in the shape of a lion.</p>

                    <hr id="tascheter">

                    <h4>Tascheter</h4>
                    <div class="5u"><span class="image left"><img src="images/minotaur.png" alt=""></span></div>
                    <p>The swift star, Tascheter, leads a constellation in the shape of a bull, and so he tends to present himself to mortals as a Minotaur. His ward is the East, which is why he watches over the subservient town of Gholam and blesses their crops so they may nourish all four central settlements.</p>

                    <p>Seeing him in the sky marks the start of the vernal equinox, and brings with him the good omen of fertile lands and rain. He has been called Aldebaran, or "the follower", in other regions of Khordad, always elevating his nature of willing and eager servitude for the good of his people.</p>

                    <hr id="satevis">

                    <h4>Satevis</h4>
                    <div class="5u"><span class="image left"><img src="images/tlincalli.jpg" alt=""></span></div>
                    <p>The brutalistic Satevis is the ender, the one that sets like the sun. She is a cosmic guardian of the West and the authority over the cycle of life and death. Her constellation is that of a scorpion so she has adopted the mortal form of a Tlincalli.</p>

                    <p>Who else if not her would watch over the military hub that is the city of Shahin. Her position however means she also works alongside Tascheter with the arrival of the autunmal equinox and season of harvest, a contrast between her tasks. Her alternate name is Antares, the red one, for the coloring of her inhuman body.</p>

                    <hr id="haftorang">

                    <h4>Haftorang</h4>
                    <div class="5u"><span class="image left"><img src="images/locathah.jpg" alt=""></span></div>
                    <p>The wise Haftorang is the religious leader of the South, the patron of Rasoul and called the seven thrones in reference to the seven <a href="../religion.html#amesha-spentas">Amesha Spentas</a>. It is said that when she deigns to grace mortals with her presence she emerges from the Southern Seas in the shape of a locathah; her constellation is that of an astral fish, which explains this choice.</p>

                    <p>She marks the beginning of the winter solstice and a reset in the natural order of nature. Also known as Fomalhaut, or the mouth of the southern fish, it is said that her word brings cosmic harmony and guidance to all those who worship her and her siblings.</p>
